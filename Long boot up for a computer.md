So, your computer is taking a long time to boot and you don't know what to do?

Here is a [Link about Windows 10 Slow Boot issues](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-slow-boot-issues/) to an articles that can help you resolve your issue.

But to make it a TL;DR, I have chosen the following: 2 solutions.

1. Is your toggle on the fast startup? It is easy for a person to speed through when completing the computer setup and they will stick to the default settings.
   It is best to untick the fast toggle under the Power Options in the control panel. The computer has power-off modes: sleep and hibernate. When a computer ins in sleep mode, no action is allowed on the computer. In hibernation mode, the computer uses less power and when you boot it up again, you can continue where you left off. It's sort of like a bear. It hibernates during the winter with the food already in its guts used to perservere through its hibernation. It will wake up and walk around its den. The computer will wake up from its hibernation and continue to perform the previous action. [Dell explains the difference betwenn sleep and hibernate mode](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-ca/000130380/how-to-wake-a-computer-or-monitor-from-sleep-suspend-or-hibernate#:~:text=Sleep%20mode%20is%20a%20power,on%2C%20but%20uses%20less%20power.) The fast boot startup puts the computer in a hybrid between sleep and hibernation mode and as a result, it pre-saves the Windows Kernel on your hard drive ready for loading when the machine is booted on.

2. Update your graphic drivers. It's in Display adapters under the Disk Management. Windows has a bad history of messing with their drivers, and
   they can become obsolete. So, it is important for the user to regularly update them, manually. It's not automatic. The updates are usually available on the PC. You just have to
   update them manually. If not, you should go to your vendor's website and inquire about these updates.
