So, your computer is taking a long time to boot and you don't know what to do?

Here is a [Link](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-slow-boot-issues/) to an articles that can help you resolve your issue.

But to make it a TL;DR, I have chosen the following: 2 solutions.

1. Is your toggle on the fast startup? It is easy for a person to speed through when completing the computer setup and they will stick to the default settings.
   It is best to untick the fast toggle under the Power Options in the control panel. The fast startup is a feature to reduce boot-up times after a shutdown. It enables quicked times for workstations to be ready and resulting in better productivity. You can ready about it [here](https://www.ninjaone.com/script-hub/how-to-enable-windows-fast-startup/#:~:text=Fast%20Boot%2C%20known%20by%20other,personal%20users%20and%20IT%20professionals.)

2. Update your graphic drivers. It's in Display adapters under the Disk Management. Windows has a bad history of messing with their drivers, and
   they can become obsolete. So, it is important for the user to regularly update them, manually. It's not automatic. The updates are usually available on the PC. You just have to
   update them manually. If not, you should go to your vendor's website and inquire about these updates.
