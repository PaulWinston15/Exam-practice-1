1. The biggest question you should ask yourself is: Is the printer turned on? It sounds dumb, but often times a printer does not show up because it is not turned on.

2. If you are using a wired printer, please make sure that the USB cable is properly connected to your PC. The safest bet is to unplug and plug it back again.

3. If you are using a wireless connection to your printer, ensure that the wireless connection is turned on. Check to see if the printer's blue wireless icon is turned on.
